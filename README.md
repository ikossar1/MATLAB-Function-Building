# MATLAB-function-building
Simple functions built in MATLAB as part of coursework for the Introduction to Computing course at Tufts University. The functions were employed in corresponding scripts, which are also attached. The functions include "IntegrationRiemann.m", "SampledSine.m", and "LinearInterp.m". The scripts include "TestRiemann.m", "SimulateADC.m", and "PlotPowerUsage.m".
